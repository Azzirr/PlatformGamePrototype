# PlatformGamePrototype

## Work in progress
This project was my first bigger project, only for JavaScript practise. I was doing first steps in working with function, classes, sprite animation sheets and more.
I learned a lot, but today I think, that I should rewrite this project from beggining if I want to continue work.

## To run this project
1. Git clone this repo.
Example: git clone https://github.com/Azzirr/PlatformGamePrototype.git

2. In your code editor install an extansion to run live server. For VSCode you can use "Live Server" created by Ritwick Dey.

3. Start your live server and run app.
